    <h1>Glaz</h1>

    <p>In a true physical sense, if you look through a telescope and see a dying star, then it is already dead in real time and has been dead for possibly millions of years. I was thinking about the likes and dislikes a person could have. Why does someone like the things they do? They interest them, make them happy, make them feel safe, comfortable, or... exactly right... and the opposite for the things they dislike. When the water reaches the nose, though, where would you be trying to look if not up? Trying to save yourself or catch another breath, maybe even if it's your last. The rush is real. But if you have ever gone swimming, then you know it feels good or even satisfying to hold your breath and dive into the water itself. It gives you a temporary feeling of control, like, "Yeah, dude!" You are doing this by your own choice (?). You get to swim around for a little more with the held-up oxygen. Or it is more correct to say that until the CO₂ in you gets too much for you to continue and you want to break that barricade and just breathe. Go up there and inhale some air. It is the overwhelming CO₂ that gets you... lack of oxygen would have only caught up way later. But in a place where there's no sun, no light, and no sense of gravity, and you are underwater, how would you know where 'up' is? Or even if you find it, how long is it going to be until you reach it and break the boundary and you are able to breathe again? A second ago when I was typing, I was trying to think about how it would be better to just stay underwater for this while, as in if there could be some way to do it, but I realized the more modest way to think would be to figure out if the better thing would be to give up on trying to find a way but rather just let the things that pulled you in guide you in further and settle down instead of trying to fight it. The struggle only grows and worsens with resistance because then you are facing it directly. If you are already underwater, has it not overtaken you anyways?</p>

    <p>How much of a fight someone can put up with is truly subjective. Somebody's strongest is someone just starting to try and vice versa. When you are in a depressive state (of any form) for too long it starts becoming the new norm if you do not actively try to push out, which is almost never the easiest thing to do. If we consider the outside of the water to be just a normal 'happy' state then maybe it is intrinsic that we defined it as that in the first place? Surely there were things that LEAD us to think and feel safer in the 'up'. What if those things are not like that anymore, not there, and you just cannot recreate them anymore. It is either you can never create them or maybe not just YET. I am talking about things that made you feel afloat. I cannot find them the same anymore. It irks me. Once you stop finding solace in things that interested you or comforted you, then you feel hollow. The duration really subjectively depends on how well you are taking it. How long is it okay to feel hollow for? I would not know if I tried. Are you the same person you were when you were 'up' there? Have I changed and if yes then has it been for good or worse? The things in life that made you feel like you... do not anymore. Maybe it's a part of growing when you are alive. Maybe it is the death- of 'you' up there. I am thinking- if this change or death was not brought about by factors you control then why did it happen? Or who did it? Minor shit happens all the time- but for substantial losses beyond my power, who do I blame? Where do I pin control? I am not blaming anyone or any power up there because I cannot take the risk to, but the question is out there. The only answer I have right now is incomplete and it's that if I am alive then there hopefully is a reason to be. I am alive and there is no parental consent in being otherwise. yet (?).</p>

    <p>The tip of the spear, which is aimed at myself and as steel does, I must keep pushing until I do... something? Until I figure out what all this is about. I feel like I MUST, as a rule, keep doing this certain 'thing' and this exact 'thing' is what makes it worse.</p>

    <p>Who are dead people- when not literally? Are they the ones who gave up pushing or are they the ones who are in the transient period between losing an older self because of things that were or were not out of their control and are trying to move on to their next life? And if they are so because of things not in their power, then will the same power bring them back or are they forsaken and is it going to be something else?</p>

    <p>Once you die, though, your views change. and they must change. Whether it makes you more depressed or happier. I cannot speak on things I do not know. Truly the best way to recognize what it has done to you is to be observant. looking at things around you. Do you find joy in the things you did anymore, or would you rather pretend that they do to hold on to what you have been for so long? Because tearing yourself off from those things might as well be equal to asking yourself to tear your limb off. I say this because I believe that prolonged isolation can almost definitely be a breeding ground for an increased sense of attachment to the things that have remained with you. It is unfortunate that a part of the soul dies off when something tragic happens. Once lost, it can not be brought back. Maybe, yeah, but not in the same way; it's never the same. It's the Ship of Theseus paradox. It hurts, and the pain is really stingy.</p>

    <p>What I am trying to get at with this essay is how pain and change brought about by factors out of your power really kill you when it was maybe the first, second, third, or whatever 'thing' that you could call your own, built by you, loved by you, and cherished as a pumpkin being raised for a contest. Is there a meter on this thing keeping track of how much I am suffering, if at all? Because at this point even brownie points from that would mean real cozy comfort, wouldn't they? Maturing and viewing things without a filter is tragic. I have been wondering about it, and I figure that the world is purple and red, and what I mean is there's love, but there's suffering, and I am on the edge with what's more. I do not wish to see things with 100 eyes just to trust or sit comfortably again with someone or some situation. I wish to feel joy when I see it and not be distrustful again. Even if it happens once, it would be a spark. I wish I could have had a little control over things that I achieved or things that I built because when what you built gets taken away for... fucking whatever, it hurts a lot.</p>

    <p>There's no control, there's no knowing, and you are left with things you had no control over, but you have them anyways, I am grateful, but if only the things I made for myself weren't as volatile as ethanol in the air, I would love to live again. I am grateful for everything. I wish I could put a cap on a pen, and the cap would get put on the pen. I wish I could put a box on the table, and then the table would have a box placed on it. I wish I could drink a glass of water and then for water to be in my system. But of course I am being taught that neither of these 3 things is possible. Evidently so. I know all too well that that's not possible. The box will levitate and get thrown off or something. The water will flow out of the bottle, and before reaching my lips, it'll curl in the air and fall off into the ground. The most basic fucking things. I just know that that isn't possible. And it makes me either really paranoid about the littlest things I do- or just anxious. Unconsciously, I think I am even starting to come to terms with it. It's as if I am Josef K. from Kafka's 'The Trial,' except I am losing the emotional and mental energy to even fight. I would end up looking at the judge and be like, "Yeah dude---you are probably right." been conditioned to a point where any achievement of mine that happened because of me or anything or any regard that I had is extremely volatile to the point where it could cease to be a good thing or a thing at all at ANY time, and no one knows when and for 0 reasons. It all gets taken away for nothing with no explanation, and I MUST treat this as normal. I am starting to cave. If I step back into myself and just look at things, then it's just hard to explain; it's like the monotonous buzz of fluorescent lights in an office.</p>

    <p>What do I learn from it all? I will try to put out an idea of what it at least FEELS like. This is all apparent. At the end of the day when the candle blows out I've learned to appreciate the little to bigger things in life. I will hold on to whatever I have now because when you face loss without explanations you just find stable things in your life real dear to you. So is it really selfish of me to be sad or depressed or anxious when anything goes wrong? Even if I am the farthest thing from showing it physically through my conversations with people or with expressions? Or letting it affect my real life? The torsion that happens when you brute force yourself to bite a bullet and continue normally because you HAVE to is intense. And when I do I just do not deserve an explanation for why the bullet was shot or why I couldn't just dodge it instead.</p>

    <p>Of course these are things that are related to me in a way that I caused them to be. My heart could stop any second I could have a brain stroke right now but those things are not under my control and neither did I cause these things to be in the first place so I am not talking about them. What I mean is things I do for myself. Things in this world that I chose or chose would bring me comfort, they have decided in some fuckass cosmic sense that I mean nothing to them. So that's how it is. any pleasure or closure I feel is chance playing itself out in that moment. and I'll be grateful for that instance. but it feels like I'm being taught not to hold on to it. because if I build a snowman tomorrow, and next day i wake up to the snowman literally not being there then that's just normal. i do not deserve to know why 5 kgs of ice disappeared when everyone else's snowman is simply fine. I must be fine with it no questions asked.</p>

    <p>is it because I am burning away the negative karma of my past life? is it because I killed an ant when I was 6 years old. I feel like I could be held up for a life sentence for not turning off a switch when I left the room for 5 minutes and I would totally understand why the judge would give such a sentence. The point I'm getting at with this is when there is no explanation- it is hard to not pin the blame to even the tiniest of your faults. Even if it is extreme. Afterall it's only fair, isn't it? Who is going to tell me not to- ask me to stop? This is just abhorrent. I must be alive to witness it and it is my duty that I make myself realize, acknowledge, and understand the process even if I could never have played a part in it.</p>

    <p>It's true that people suffer more than me in a lot of parts of the world. I acknowledge both the things 1 is that my suffering matters because i am alive to feel it and as long as i do not bother any one else its fine and second is that it doesn't matter and shouldn't matter to me simply because others suffer more. it's a paradox again. Me typing out this essay is hypocritical. It's almost as if I am dead to the cause. Why should I try to find meaning when I do not deserve to? Why do I NOT deserve to? when not given explanations I will make them up for my sanity's sake.</p>

    <p>When comfort finds its way to me, I'll have to find a way to heal myself out of thinking that it will dissolve without warning, that it will vanish as quickly as it came. I don't know in what ways exactly the healing is possible. And it's not really forever. I am going to die one day anyways, and if reincarnation is real, I will only be carrying a few lessons out of here. God bless the moments that make me happy, because I am grateful, and I always will be. All that has happened to me has done a lot to change me, or at least it feels like so. But I am not aiming to be pessimistic. Whatever change is meant to happen to me definitely will, and I will be trying my best to take it as well as possible.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whatever happens, I do realize that only as long as I am alive, this too is temporary- even if it lasts for years, it is temporary. Just as this was, I can and will find happiness again too or let it find me. The potential to see good in things isn't lost but preserved and use in a sacred way.</p>

    <p>It is immature to find or look for permanence in tragedy as it is supposed to leave scars and lessons, not eternal outlooks for life. I can see both and all aspects of things---it's just more natural now to believe that nothing good is meant to happen in the real world without takeaways. It's never rainbows and sunshine. If it is, then there's more purple and red. I can see a 100 different aspects. to know how each scenario would play out, but I am not an effect. I cannot cause things. I just do not hold the power to. If I tried, I would phase right through it, so the best I do is observe and be grateful. It is inevitable to comfort in it, if you could really call being paranoid when good things happen "comfort." It's not healing, but the best I can do is hold myself. And yeah, also it's the eyes. It's always the eyes. You could learn a lot about the person from their eyes; it's almost as if they're a device capable of capturing a snapshot of the person's last 2-5 months if you look well enough.</p>

    <p>It is pointless and harmful to witness a state and declare fate. But the limbo that comes with the shit that happened changing you so hard in one fell swing that you feel knocked out of yourself without being given much time to change to it or adapt to it. So the part of you that felt like *you* shrivels off for a while but your body is physically there day to day.. but in any case, when you are alive after you died before you were supposed to, is it just your eyes that are dead?</p>
