    <h1>Anchors</h1>

    <p>what made me write this was a recurring thought of mine. Unlike most other essays where I would know what direction it is headed in, this one could divide into multiple tangents because the emotion and the way of thinking that goes with it is recursive in and of itself. Is the topic for today 'suicide ideation'? How does feeling content or cozy physically help with feeling the same mentally. and how do you tell a squirrel who's breathing very quickly because it looped a tree 12 times from a dying one in its last bursts of energy? I realize that a lot of questions in the introduction but I'm glad I don't have my English teacher on my neck anymore. regardless. Those are somethings I want to at least TRY to get HONEST answers out of. not emotional, not sway-y ones but rational ones.</p>

    <p>I had this idea and it is quite observable for yourself that if you're watching a movie or reading a book and it seems so stale- as in nothing is happening everything is looping around it's all just boring then quite often the plot is actually about the protagonist's development going through it, not the story itself. changes, adapting to them, (or not) it all becomes a part of the movie when the plot is curved. I have also been thinking about how often it is that people tend to find themselves anchored to their lives and the anchor is not their own. is it okay to not be aware of this? is it a problem though- does it need to be fixed? how long can a brain and body system run on fumes before something gives? is it necessary for it to give out and if that does happen then does it mean death or worse? suffering becomes normalized when we stop living for ourselves, and recognizing that collision point is both the crisis and the possibility</p>

    <p>At the same time, I do acknowledge that misfortune rarely cares about rationale and that it isn't always the perfect thing to do to nudge someone towards rationality when they're in a situation that clearly blinds them from it. I want to talk about the exhaustion, the emotional wreckage and the blurring of the line between living and dragging yourself that comes with the romanticization of death.</p>

    <h2>Houston, We Have a Problem</h2>

    <p>When it begins it stings. It stings hard. You feel the lack of support and your beams being just taken away and that might just be the case, but you know that you're alive dude and you are your best support system. at least- for now.</p>

    <p>and on a side note I acknowledge, and I know for a fact that getting support is not as easy as "hey I need help". it is way more nuanced than just texting someone straight out and has way more caveats to it the longer you think about it. it takes real strength and a certain toll on your state of being to be able to do even that and yet it comes with its own real life repercussions which COULD end up making it worse if the people you're reaching out to are not the right people. Now I want to talk about 3 important phases as I like to break them down.</p>

    <p>Now initially when suffering one tries to find solutions to it. The first phase is often the hardest. The mind scrambles like an egg trying to look for viable solutions. anything that helps. Since the heart is absolutely fried at that moment, those solutions or ideas turn out weak and not as good as intended. This phase is like walking on a minefield with blindfolds. This is important because this rush hour is also the time when many people leave us forever and by that, I mean the obvious. This is what makes the zero hour so sensitive.</p>

    <p>Next comes a middle phase which could have many forms like going totally numb, questioning everything like faith, God, fate, yourself, beginning seeking help and even wanting to seek help. Then finally comes the last phase, which is the most formative and influential in that person's life. It is the longest of the 3 phases and given the caliber of a person can be incredibly introspective and very impactful. But I mean after all, does it even matter? Positives and negatives… do they even exist at that point?</p>

    <h2>The Fall from Grace</h2>

    <p>let's just try to get into the thick of it but layer by layer. suffering can be prolonged or it can be quick. really depends on your karmic credit card- but that's besides the matter. How long does someone go by living in a particular shade of suffering without it becoming the norm? I'm wondering- if something sad or devastating happens, then the outlook towards it does depend person to person but if we take just 1 out of the sample pool and observe, then- objectively how often is it that a continued state of being becomes normalized and if death is not allowed... what happens then?</p>

    <p>What I think and to some extent know happens in the long run is an incredibly unsustainable state of being where you're living but- it's not YOU who is alive. you died already and that's the truth. what follows now is watching your remains neglect whatever is left of you and move on in life not from will but from the momentum of faith, pressure to please, a little spark of yourself that wishes to see an end to the throb even if it's nowhere to be found in the foreseeable future. And let me tell you this- this hollow state of living is painful. it's like being sleepy in a lecture of your favorite professor oh you can't wait for it to end as quickly as possible but at the same time you want to keep your head up just to appreciate the professor. let's face it; the want to commit suicide is real. but at the same time certain anchors holding that thought back are also equally real. This 'tug' is what the force is. and you are the rope.</p>

    <h2>And so, Begins the Fall</h2>

    <p>here I want to bring in the emotional aspect of it all. in the to and fro of life it is possible to forget the push behind it all. and if someone is suicidal then it's even worse- because now even that push doesn't even matter anymore. suicide ideation- I like to believe is a state of being that comes up in the later stage of grieving or suffering. It comes from prolonged wrestling between fighting for answers and not getting any but rising up again and looking for the answer in a different book. except the books are hogged up- torn- burnt and the pages aren't really visible. there's a different sort of intensity you can feel emotions with at this point before you burn yourself out and end up in one of the two scenarios: continue feeling with the same intensity, or feel everything but you're unable to hold emotions to their original intended value.</p>

    <p>what I mean by that is sometimes tragedy hits you in a way where it could end up making someone hyperaware of their emotions, and more importantly of the expressions and emotions conveyed by others. and its never ideal when you're overanalyzing everything, everywhere, all at once. A brain always running on full speed might seem like a strong engine, but it isn't an efficient one, it is bound to give up and give up it will at one point, quite aggressively.</p>

    <p>on the flip side, when you're dead to emotions, even your own. It could be because you were taught not so kindly and … even unfortunately that YOUR emotions don't matter! What you feel or what you WANT to feel is not important, your wants and desires if left unchecked don't mean anything at all. yeah, it is very breaking. eventually it could turn into a self-induced, self-ignorance where you're imposing those rules onto yourself.</p>

    <p>living for yourself still gives you a nudge towards wanting to get better, wanting to get help or maybe just punching yourself through it (wouldn't recommend it my sister says it can harm bones for later in life and that scared me enough).</p>

    <p>but that about when you're not living for yourself. Your daily life, your habits, your schedules, your goals, your rituals and rites are not really aligned with …. you. I don't think it's too long that a body to run on just hopes and dreams before at least something gives right?</p>

    <h2>When the Fumes run out</h2>

    <p>to discuss what happens when that engine carrying you out. and by that I don't mean death, certainly not! death in the physical sense of self would be tragic in. hmm dare I say most cases? But not all. Instead, what I mean is- a failure at being able to hug yourself anymore. yeah. literally. it does collapse. at this point you recognize that everything is meant/built to be fucking against you. Your thoughts don't matter. Your wishes and prayers are reaching a void and that's it. The universe isn't listening to you. your desires can go kill themselves. that's what it feels like doesn't it? the cruel part is that- at this point you probably teach yourself that, that IS the truth. because you know what not knowing that would mean right?</p>

    <p>It would mean running that long filthy race of begging for cosmic comfort once again. digging for answers all over again. And oh boy you can't do that! you're half a soul that was now. Your body is half of what it was at the beginning of it all. The most traumatic outcome of this all is that the person not only ends up believing that their identity and their likes are false and don't deserve fulfillment, but they ACTIVELY choose to act against everything that could comfort them. getting into the introspective part of it, it happens when (and this isn't a final definition it's just what I think happens best) your theology, your faith, your real life circumstances your guts all collide into a mess. You know you're suffering but you know it's not deep enough and it could be worse. You know this seems like the end but you're aware that it clearly is not.</p>

    <p>That beloved reader is not a fault. it's a lesson learnt in tears, a fuck ton of them. in the midst of this where does the idea of suicide pop in? I think it was the first paragraph! yeah. It was always there. it's just now that the idea is real and a totally viable possibility which was not the case before, because what was then was- hope. not anymore. suicide ideation refers to the practice of what you thought I was going to do a google definition lol. it's the unconscious outcome when you are living for yourself anymore. it's when the urge to get out and just leave is as strong as that little spark of momentum from faith, a tinyyyy ray of hope, all collide and you're the focal point, so you burn up. You want to die but you also don't. You could do it right now, but you also can not. imagine going through every single day singing a happy song and dancing in your empty room all by yourself, you forget the lyrics of a particular part and filling it up with "kill yourself" in the tune of the song, fitting it perfectly with the rhythm and continue singing and dancing? every single day? in different forms? it guts you is what it does.</p>

    <h2>Endurance and Surrender</h2>

    <p>From a theist point of view, you simply being alive right now in that moment is proof enough that there are plans for you. from an atheist lens sometimes, you need to get the incredibly-hard-to-get-shit-together, together. It is incredibly hard. you're actively working against a force that literally EXISTS to not let you be able to do so. it's ironic. And since human strength and resilience are subjective it could easy and it could be horrifying for some people. and that's the tragic part. from the outside it is just so incredibly hard to tell how long someone CAN suffer for.</p>

    <p>a marine or a national guard might seem like the first person you want on your team if you're trying to survive on the isolated island because they are so resilient but once that wears off it would be harrowing to see the most strong people back off and give up if that happens. on the same side of the coin you could have normal looking people who were born to withstand whatever is thrown at them and give and give and give and give and keep fucking giving regardless of if they even have something to and still go on with their lives.</p>

    <p>it's not about being able to live after it happens, it about how long can you live in a particular state of mind for so long until it changes into an even worse state of mind. would you keep living ? would you just keep throwing yourself at problems when you're half starving and have 0 motivation to lift yourself mentally but the push is that if everything else fucking fails you just want to live to see what the final outcome WOULD be?? at this point am I trying to prove god or myself ? or am I trying to prove fate? I don't want everything to end at all and for sure a lot of people don't as their first choice. At one point it goes from "this is not good" to "how worse can this get" when you're actively trying to push forward but have no motivation to.</p>

    <h2>Consequences and Phases</h2>

    <p>SO, with all of those things merging and battling it out in a single hot mess what happens to the person? its real confusing. You want to give up- you have a list of reasons for doing so and you also have a list for not doing so. questioning God on the daily does not help either. You run out of prayer tokens while you're praying and boom and that is a REAL sucker because trust me, I have, so far 0 idea of how to get more. Nothing works and to be completely honest with you I think its lottery system lol. you already gave up God though love, didn't you? why are you still reaching out? this is the worst part of it all. This annoying little pesky part of you that keeps hoping keeps praying and wishing… keeps dragging you on this sandpaper where you lose and wither yourself out the longer you go. Who knows what's at the end and that's what drives you to this point. that's the only thing pushing you forward even if it's killing you and stinging and burning. What if there is nothing at the end? Is it the knowledge of the dead?</p>

    <p>can you question consequences that have not yet played out?</p>

    <p>it's hard to find the mental strength to deal with the present, past, the foreseeable and deep future all at the same time and tie them on to one superior judgement that makes them ALL look well knit. in a nutshell- it is messed up.</p>

    <h2>The Cold and the Body</h2>

    <p>in this final part of the essay, I want to bring out the guttural part of being in this situation. which is the loop of it all. If you read so far and were waiting for a conclusion, then I am sorry to disappoint you because. Well, I as a person don't know the answer myself yet; (I'm alive). Isn't that the horror of it? The loop? How scary it is to live in it every day and to recognize it and yet being able to do nothing about it? No matter how warm your core is if your extremities are frozen you will never be comfortable. The opposite may not be true.</p>

    <p>covered in jackets driving a bike on a winter morning with the helmet but the visor opens, the wind hitting your flushed nose and cheeks is gentle sort of humbling. it's one of the few really intimate things I've been able to feel in this long stretch. I am in control but how uncomfortable can it get anyways? How cold can it get anyways? Observing this from 100 angles and being hypercritical of every positive situation henceforth assuming it to be random luck or simply fate. Tell yourself that you don't deserve immediate help. Dragging yourself to see how much you can swallow because after all other attempts seem to fail anyways. Telling yourself that your smile isn't pretty. Dissociation. Feeling like you're watching a hollow shell of yourself living out your life for you and that you are not actually playing a role in it. closure of any form at this point would be a gift. a blessing.</p>

    <p>You question whether a closure or explanation is even deserved at this point. Why do you even look or beg for one when the damage is irreversibly done. is calling it irreversible the right thing? or is waiting and waiting to check if you're right the right thing? is it okay to wait until you die just to know- just for the sake of it? when does it become from "I'll wait for a glimmering ray of hope" to "I've been on this path for so long- waiting for something that at this point the person who wanted the explanation is not there anymore". maybe its permanent. and hopefully it is. because I can't just go through THIS and leave learning nothing. Hello, I hope I carry certain values to my next life like a learned person if I'm able to take anything at all. This is a glimpse of what suicidal ideation might look like. If we get into the nitty gritty of it you might start starving yourself because honestly there's no point in getting a full build right? At point those ribs just look interesting in the mirror in the morning showers. Then there's higher levels of self-neglect.</p>

    <p>you look at yourself one fine night and ask yourself what your reasons are to even stay anymore and the answers do not even have your own name.</p>
